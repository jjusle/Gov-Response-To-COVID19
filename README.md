# Gov-Response-To-COVID19
This is my UCSC ECON 124 (Machine Learning for Economists) Final Project on Government Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

# Abstract
The question for this research paper is to analyze and predict rigidity of the average of the
13 coded Public Health Measures of the dataset, which are: school, domestic, travel, travel_dom,
curf, mass, elect, sport, rest, testing, surveillance, masks, and state. Where it is valued at 0.5 if
they are localized or partial, 1 if they are national or strict, and 0 indicates no measures. This is
interesting because of how some countries act and perform differently compared to other
countries even with similar variables and we can measure how the publicâ€™s health is generally
doing and how the government is responding to these Public Health Measures. It is only
measured if there are at least 10 out of 13 measures coded.
